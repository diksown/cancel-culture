        "\n",
        "Beatriz Proenca presented a study on using machine learning to differentiate between clean and poisoned water using Wi-Fi signals. Four classifiers were tested, achieving high accuracy, with Adaboost performing the best at 92%.\n",

        "## Cancer Recurrence Prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "Diego Giaretta presented a study that used machine learning techniques to predict cancer recurrence from open databases. The study used Naive-Bayes and SVM algorithms for training and achieved 99% accuracy through SVM with K-fold cross-validation, identifying features such as age, tumor size, and receptor status. The study was structured with sections presenting concepts, methodology, results, conclusion, and next steps.\n",

        "\n",
        "Dikson Santos presented about CatBoost, a machine learning algorithm designed to tackle classification and regression problems. This algorithm is based on gradient boosting decision trees and is known for its ability to handle categorical features in large and complex datasets, resulting in high accuracy. During the presentation, John discussed how CatBoost compares to other popular machine learning algorithms\n"
